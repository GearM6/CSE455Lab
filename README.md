CSE 455 Lab 2 - Version Control
Matt Marra - Cesar Guerrero - Billy Juergens (?)

We decided to use GitHub as our version controller for this lab.
It is just a simple html page using Bootstrap that we can make easy changes to without worrying about damaging the whole project.

We have also included a simple "test" version of The Swole App. Project. It is coded in C++ and will later be translated into javascript to implement in the android platform. The "test" files include "Swole.cpp" and "Swole.h".
